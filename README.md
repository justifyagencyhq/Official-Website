## Technologies Used
 - [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com): We love this framework alot, and we are absolutely not going away from it. It's fast, scalable, easy-to-use. We used it,
 at first it looks like that it's too heavy but after compilation our CSS Size is only 3KB ü§Ø
 - [AlpineJS](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine): We don't like to play with DOM Selectors anymore, even for simpler things + We are using VueJS everyday, so it's a deal-deal
 - [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)**: It's Simple, that's it
 - [IonIcons](https://ionicons.com/): This is completely biased, our cat loves it so üòç
 - [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/): It's simple, with Free SSL + Auto-Deployment. We can roll-back easily and we're also using built-in form collector.
 - [Sal.js](https://mciastek.github.io/sal/): Lightweight scroll animation library (Zero Dependencies) and it's just super minimal.
 - [GitHub](https://github.com): It's free for teams now so ü•≥
 - [Favicons](https://www.favicon-generator.org/) - It worked for us, and provided us the zip file of different sizes
